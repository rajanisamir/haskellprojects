# haskellprojects
These are an assortment of projects I completed in Haskell as part of my Honors Intro to CS I course at UChicago. Working in a functional language proved to be a difficult but rewarding experience, and the projects included here range from a calculator based on the Peano axioms, to a parser that separates words, to a Monte Carlo simulation that approximates pi. Parts of the code in this repository, such as function templates, were instructor-provided, but the vast majority of the logic and function implementations were written by me.
